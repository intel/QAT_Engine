## Common Features to qat_hw & qat_sw
* [QAT_HW & QAT_SW Co-existence with runtime configuration](qat_coex.md#qat-hw-and-qat-sw-co-existence)
* [OpenSSL 3.0 Provider Support](qat_common.md#openssl-30-provider-support)
* [FIPS 140-3 Certification requirements Support using QAT Provider](qat_common.md#fips-140-3-certification-requirements-support-using-qat-provider)
* [Binary RPM Package](qat_common.md#binary-rpm-package)

Note: RSA Padding schemes are handled by OpenSSL\* or BoringSSL\* rather than accelerated, so the
engine supports the same padding schemes as OpenSSL\* or BoringSSL\* does natively.
